<section class="content"><p>Solo project, brought from concept to market. I originally conceived the idea for the Kit when I tried to decorate my bedroom with an e-stop button. No consumer grade products were available, so I decided to make&nbsp;one.  </p>
<p>At it’s peak, product had sales in the 1000’s of units a year, and has been sold through ThinkGeek, Newbury Comics, Fab.com, Urban Outfitters, and other&nbsp;retailers.  </p>
<p>Skills used included component selection, vendor management, graphic design, web development, <span class="caps">B2B</span> sales,&nbsp;photography</p>
