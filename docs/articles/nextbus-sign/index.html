<section class="content"><p>The NextBus sign was a personal project and a skill builder. It connects to the NextBus <span class="caps">API</span> which publishes a data feed for the bus arrival times on the MBTA and other transit&nbsp;systems.  </p>
<p>I developed this project for personal use, but was constantly thinking about what a commercialization effort would entail. The key obstacle was fitting a business model to the cost of maintaining an <span class="caps">API</span>, even though the hardware lends itself to a one time&nbsp;sale.</p>
<p>On the technical / design end, I developed the graphics and industrial design, mechanical housing, and custom circuit&nbsp;boards.</p>
<p>The sign uses a cloud connected Particle as the main microcontroller. To shorten development time, the NextBus <span class="caps">API</span> is processed off the microcontroller in Python and a short string is sent to the device itself through Particle’s cloud back end. The Python script runs on an AWS instance in Amazon’s&nbsp;cloud.</p>
