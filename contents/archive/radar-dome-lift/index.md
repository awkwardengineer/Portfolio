The radar dome was split and later reassembled as part of a radar dish upgrade program.  

Worked as part of a two person team to ensure that the cap could be safely removed and reinstalled. I designed the lifting fixtures and pick points for the 110,000lb lift and analyzed the structure to ensure the split dome halves would fit back together again.
