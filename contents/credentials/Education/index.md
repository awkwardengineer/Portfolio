# B.S. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, WPI '07, HIGH HONORS

Typically it's the letter "A" in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) and a new project that's given me cause to continue my education. I've taken grad classes at Tufts, MIT, and MassArt and I've taken online classes at Coursera and MITx. I self teach and I read voraciously.
