# WRIGHTGRID, LLC
Head of Product Development. I lead the mechanical engineering and industrial design efforts for a cell phone charging startup. Through iteration, developed a deep understanding of product requirements across the complete product lifecycle, from sale through manufacture, installation, customer use, and service. I developed the product form and worked very closely with our manufacturing partner to design for their fabrication processes.

As the company grew from a bootstrapped operation to an angel funded company, I became responsible for hiring the engineering team, mentoring the electrical and embedded engineers, and milestone and schedule planning.
