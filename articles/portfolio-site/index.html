<section class="content"><p>This portfolio is both a project showcase and a skills builder for myself. It started as a fork of the <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/">Agency</a> Bootstrap template which I initially modified to hardcode this site in&nbsp;<span class="caps">HTML</span>.  </p>
<p>I was looking for an easier way to update the site and had some interest in doing more with&nbsp;NodeJS.  </p>
<p>I settled on using <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">wintersmith.io</a>, a static website generator. Run on Node.js, it uses a simple folder structure and markdown files to automatically a generate a staticly served website. In this case, my portfolio is only a single page, but the separate folders and files for each project make everything easier to&nbsp;manage.  </p>
<p>Wintersmith didnâ€™t work perfectly out of the box, as I had to convert the existing hardcoded site into templates that could work with the wintersmith&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>The static site is both managed and hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/awkwardengineer/Portfolio">Github&nbsp;repo</a></p>
